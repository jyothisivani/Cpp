# Experiment 12(a)
## Aim : Write a C++ Program to illustrate early binding.
### Step by Step procedure for the experiment
Step 1: Include the required header files (iostream).

Step 2: Create a class (Add) and define multiple methods with the same name add() but with the different data type and functionality same.

Step 3: Define the functionality in member function.

Step 4: Create a main() method.

Step 5: Creating object of Add as obj

Step 6: Call the member function add() with respective parameters.

Step 7: return 0 to exit form the program execution

# Experiment 12(b)
## Aim : Write a C++ Program to illustrate late binding.
### Step by Step procedure of the experiment
Step 1 - Include the required header files (iostream)

Step 2 - Create a base class (Base) with the following class members as public members. show() as member function

Step 3 - Create a Derived class (Derived) with the following class members as public members. show() as member function

Step 4 - Implement the member functions with the respective code.

Step 5 - Create a main() method.

Step 6 - Create a pointer to Base class as bp.

Step 7 - Allocate the memory to class Derived using new operator.

Step 8 - Call the member function show() with bp.

Step 9 - return 0 to exit form the program execution.

# Experiment 12(c)
## Aim : Write a C++ Program to illustrate concept of Virtual Functions.
### Step by Step Procedure for the Experiment
Step 1: Include the required header files (iostream).

Step 2: Declare the base class A with data member x.

Step 3: Declare and define the virtual function display().

Step 4: Create the derived class B from the base class.

Step 5: Declare and define the functions display().

Step 6: In the main function, Create the base class pointer variable.

Step 7: Create the derived class object and call the function display() using the derived class object and pointer.

Step 8: return 0 and exit the program.

# Experiment 12(d)
## Aim : Write a C++ Program on Abstract classes.
### Step by Step Procedure for the Experiment
Step 1 - Include the required header files (iostream and string.h).

Step 2 - Create a base class (Base) with the following: x as data member, getX() as member function.

Step 3- Create a pure virtual function in a base class with syntax virtual returntype fun()=0.

Step 4 - Create a Derived class (Derived) with the following: y as data member, fun() as member function.

Step 5 - Implement the member functions with the respective code.

Step 6 - Create a main() method.

Step 7 - Creating an object of Derived as d.

Step 8 - Finally, call the member function fun() using derived class object.

Step 9 - return 0 to exit form the program execution..

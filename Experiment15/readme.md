# Experiment 15(a)
## Aim : Write a C++ program to overload unary operator.
### Step by Step procedure for the experiment
Step 1 - Include the required header files (iostream).

Step 2 - Create a class (Test) with num as private class member. Print() as member function.

Step 3 - Define the operator function as void operator ++() inside the class.

Step 4 - Write respective code for member function Print().

Step 5 - Create a main method().

Step 6 - Create an object named (tt) inside the main method.

Step 7 - Call the operator function.

Step 8 - Call the member function Print.

Step 9 - return 0 to exit form the program execution.

# Experiment 15(b)
## Aim : Write a C++ program to overload binary operator.
### Step by Step procedure for the experiment:
Step 1 - Include the required header files (iostream).

Step 2 - Create a class (A) with x as private class member. display() as member function.

Step 3 - Define the operator function as void operator +(A) inside the class.

Step 4 - Write respective code for void A :: operator+(A a).

Step 5 - Create a main method().

Step 6 - Create two objects named a1 and a2 inside the main method and assign values to them.

Step 7 - Add two objects.

Step 8 - return 0 to exit form the program execution.
